Strategy Design Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)

This pattern is used when two or more childs have a common capabilty but the parent dont have that.

In this case we use strategy design pattern through which we make an interface which have the strategies listed in them.
Then that child interface is called from the child class to deliver that capability.

This pattern helps to define multiple algorithm for the task and we can select any algorithm
depending on the situation.
